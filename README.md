<h1>File Integrity Monitor</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Created a simple File Integrity Monitor from scratch using PowerShell. I wanted to showcase my skills in powershell combined with the integrity portion of the CIA traid. A very simple project hoping to demonstrate my understanding in Integrity and how it can be used in Information Security to safeguard information.  (A File Integrity Monitor tool is a security tool designed to monitor and detect any unauthorized changes made to files and directories on a Windows operating system.
